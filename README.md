# Love-Mode7
This is a implementation of the SNES's "Mode 7" graphical mode written in Lua with the LÃ–VE engine. Here, we are rendering the entire effect with the CPU, so there's no pixel shaders. The effect is also a quite simple, and once the game engine you're working has a way to read the pixels colors of a image and draw them on screen, you can port it to everything you want.

Sadly, I can't release the Mario's Kart map together the source code since is a copyrighted image, but you can [download it from here](https://mkpc.malahieude.net/images/maps/map1.png) and set the effect config to use it.
